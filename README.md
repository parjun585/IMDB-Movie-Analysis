# Project Description:-
IMDB Movie Analysis project is about finding trends and insights about movies dataset from IMDB reviewing website. In this project, I have used the imdb_movie dataset provided by trainity and drawn some conclusions. I have provided insights to topics and answered the questions asked by the management team. I have used Google Spreadsheets and Microsoft Excel for data analytics and data visualization.

# Approach:-
Firstly, I have used the basics of the data analytics process to clean the raw data and ask questions from cleaned data. Then, I have used data wrangling to make small data frames for relevant insights to answer all the possible questions. Finally, I combined all the results and visuals into this report.
# Tech-Stack Used:-
I have used the web based application “Google Sheets” which is part of google online docs and “Microsoft Excel for Mac version 16.70” for performing various functions on spreadsheets. Both of these software provide ease of work and make data sharing and real time tracking very easy.
